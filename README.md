# javalabra_gitloader

Contains simple script for downloading every repository from repos.txt (can actually be any .txt-file).

Example usage:

```./javalab_loader.sh repos.txt```


Made for javalabra_2016k-course because (we) assistans were lazy and didn't want to download each repo one by one (duh).
